\arguments{
\item{dt}{a data.table with the data of the network to be trained. Previously folded with the 'dbnR' package or other means.}

\item{max_size}{maximum number of timeslices of the DBN. Markovian order 1 equals size 2, and so on.}

\item{n_inds}{number of particles used in the algorithm.}

\item{n_it}{maximum number of iterations that the algorithm can perform.}

\item{in_cte}{parameter that varies the effect of the inertia}

\item{gb_cte}{parameter that varies the effect of the global best}

\item{lb_cte}{parameter that varies the effect of the local best}

\item{v_probs}{vector that defines the random velocity initialization probabilities}

\item{p}{parameter of the truncated geometric distribution for sampling edges}

\item{r_probs}{vector that defines the range of random variation of gb_cte and lb_cte}

\item{cte}{boolean that defines whether the parameters remain constant or vary as the execution progresses}
}
\value{
A 'dbn' object with the structure of the best network found
}
\description{
Given a dataset and the desired Markovian order, this function returns a DBN
structure ready to be fitted with the 'dbnR' package. It requires a 'folded' dataset,
meaning that all variables have to be in the format 'xxxx_t_y', where 'xxxx' is 
the name of the variable and 'y' is the time-slice of the variable. This folding
can be done manually by shifting the columns and renaming them or automatically
via the 'dbnR' package.
